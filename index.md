<h2> Camas High School Events </h2>
<h3> Annual Blood Drive</h3>
<p>The Camas chapter of Red Cross puts on an annual blood drive to raise blood for those in need. One pint of blood can save up to three lives! Members of the club raise awareness within the school, sign up volunteers, man the canteens, and of course give blood. This is one of the crucial volunteering events for Red Cross and can make a large difference within the community.</p>
